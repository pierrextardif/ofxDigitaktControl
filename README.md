# ofxDigitaktControl

Repository to control the parameters of the [Digitakt](https://www.elektron.se/products/digitakt/) from [Openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)


This isn't a real addon, but it has the parameters pre defined for easier control.

Find a pre-Comlied version of it [here](./example/bin/example.app).
You will need to have the 1.11 firmware or newer for the Digitakt, and MAC OS Mojave (10.14.6), or newer.

### Structure
The addon works with [ofxGUI](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/addons/ofxGui) and [ofxMidi](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi), that's the only dependency.

The structure of the control panel is simple :
* the parameters are sent when the Send buttons are triggered:
each of them sends to each different panels on the Digitakt.
* the parameters are set for each channel, each channel is set in the mainParams.


## Getting Started
Plug the Digitakt to the computer using the USB cable which comes with it.

Download the addon ofxMidi, from [here](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi).
